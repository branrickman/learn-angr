# learn-angr
A pedagogical CTF to teach symbolic execution with the angr toolset

## Installation
###### The following instructions assume the user is on a linux machine.

Follow the instructions in the CTFd documentation, under "Deployment/Installation": https://docs.ctfd.io/docs 

The final steps (not included in the above docs) are:
```
cd <path to your CTFd install>
sudo docker-compose up
```

Once this is done and docker is running you can point your web browser of choice to `localhost:8000` and set up an admin account!
